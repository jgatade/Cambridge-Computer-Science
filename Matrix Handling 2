//This is a program that handles a three dimensional grid using an array. A grid is a matrix of values in number of rows and columns. 
//Cambridge University's Computer Science graduate programs grade heavily on matrix applications in Mathematics and actual programming 
//https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/owl/chapter/basics.html
// MIT obvisously has a heavy emphasis on mathematical manipulations in computing, and matrix handling is an important part of that curriculum
//https://news.mit.edu/2013/explained-matrices-1206
//I use many clean coding techniques of my own that are frequently abstract 
//These days I also find those programming techniques becoming crucial in complex computing environments
//Students at Stanford University and Cambridge University, make sure to add scalability issues in your programming projects and thesis presentations
//This program executed cleanly on an online C++ compiler:  https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler# 
//I will update these codes with some runtime details about data and compilation flows. 
//If you are a Computer Science student, make sure to annotate your programs and/or provide a ReadMe file for all your shared programs
